## Reference Guide for the Stomata Automatic Detector

#### 1. Overview

-   The Stomata Automatic Detector is a high-throughput microscope image multi-object detection and intelligent recognition system for plant stomatal phenotypic traits, and it is developed by *Python3* language based on *TensorFlow*, *Keras*, *PyQt5*, *OpenCV* frameworks.
    
-   The Stomata Automatic Detector mainly consists of five modules: ***File***, ***Detect***, ***Settings***, ***Edit***, ***View***, ***Language***, ***Help***.
    
### 2. Operation
- Unzip the downloaded compressed package
- ``` cd stomata-auto-detector-v1.2```
- The file structure of our system is as below
```
stomata-auto-detector-xxx
  |__stomata-auto-detector-xxx.exe (the executive file)
  |
  |__resource 
  |         |_____icons (the background pic and logo of system)
  |         |_____images (saved images after single image detection)
  |         |_____info-detected (saved info after single image detection)
  |         |_____param-data (record the values)
  |                        |___model_param_data.txt 
  |                        |___unit_conv_data.txt
  |__utils
         |__json__detection_config.json (configuration of detection)
         |__models__detection_model.h5 (the trained model with the best performance)
```
- Double click ```.exe``` file, then run the system
- The detail operations are in **Demo video**   
              
### 3. Modules

-   ***File*** : It includes the "***Open***" submenu and the "***Quit System***" option.
    
    -   the "***Open***" submenu also contains two options, "***Open Image***" and "***Open Dir***".
        
    -   When "***Open Image***" is selected, an image file dialog will pop up, then select the demand single image, the selected image to be detected will appear in the upper-left area of this system.
        
    -   When "***Open Dir***" is selected, the same file dialog will appear, and then select the demand image directory that needs to be detected in batches.'
        
-   ***Detect*** : It includes two options, "***Detect Image***" and "***Detect Dir***".
    
    -   Refer to the operations of "***File***" module, These two options could detect the chosen image or dir, respectively.
        
-   ***Settings*** : It includes two options: "***Unit Conversion***" and "***Model Parameter***".
    
    -   "***Unit Conversion***": Calculating the ratio of the scale of the microscope image to its pixel length. The default `100 `represents 100 $\mu m$ scale, i.e. 20x magnification in our given `maize_20x`images is equivalent to the 100 $\mu m$ scale. The default `433` represents the pixel length of the 100 $\mu m$ black line.
        
    -   "***Model Parameter***": including "***Stomata Minimum Confidence***" and "***NMS-threshold***", both parameter could adjust the accuracy of detection model and eliminate overlapped bouding-boxes.
        
-   ***Edit*** : It includes two options: "***Reset System***" and "***Clean Caches***".
    
    -   When "***Reset System***" option is selected, the system will be reset to the initial state, and several parameters will go back to the default values.
        
    -   When "***Clean Caches***" option is selected, the cache data saved in the corresponding directory after the stomata detection of the system, so as to release the resources occupied by the system.
        
-   ***View*** : It includes the "***Image Preview***" option.
    
    -   When click this option, a file dialog will pop up, and then select the demand image folder, and the chosn images will be displayed in two-column alignment.
        
-   ***Language*** : It includes the "***English***" option.
    
    -   This module represents the corresponding language of the current system.
        
-   ***Help*** : It includes two options: "***Website***" and "***About***".
    
    -   When click the "***Website***" option, the system will automatically jump to the corresponding official website.
        
    -   The "***About***" option records the sytstem information and copyright details.
